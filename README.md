# diretto API Documentations

The Distributed Reporting Toolkit (diretto) project offers an open source solution for distributed on-site media reporting and collaborative event coverage in realtime. For more information about the diretto project, please visit diretto.org online. 

These documents describe the API of the diretto platform. They should be regarded as specifications when implementing clients or services for the platform. 

## Introduction

The diretto APIs are RESTful HTTP-based web service interfaces. Most of the data is encoded using JSON.

## API v1
The first API version is the result of our initial platform prototype.

## API v2
The second API version is an improved version, introducing a modular API family, revised API design and several new features.
